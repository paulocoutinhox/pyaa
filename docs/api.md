# API

The PyAA project is configured to use Django Rest Framework.

All URLs to the APIs are inside path `DOMAIN + API + RESOURCE`, example:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/customer
```

Most resources are protected by authentication header `Authorization: Bearer XYZ` with view property in Python `permission_classes = [AppModelPermissions]`. But if you need allow public access to some resource view use `permission_classes = [AllowAny]`.

The token APIs to create and refresh are `http://localhost:8000/api/token/` and `http://localhost:8000/api/token/refresh/`.

The schema can be acessed by:
- http://localhost:8000/api/schema
- http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc
- http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui
